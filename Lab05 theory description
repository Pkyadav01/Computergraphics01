Theory of 2D Transformation

Two–dimensional (2D) transformation is a fundamental concept in computer graphics used to change the position, size, shape, and orientation of objects in a 2D plane. These transformations are performed on graphical objects represented by their coordinates . Common 2D transformations include translation, scaling, rotation, reflection, and shearing.

To perform transformations efficiently, homogeneous coordinates are used, where a 2D point  is represented as . This allows all transformations to be expressed using matrix multiplication

1. Translation

Translation moves an object from one position to another without changing its shape or size.

If an object is translated by  in the x-direction and  in the y-direction, the new coordinates are:

x' = x + t_x,\quad y' = y + t_y

Translation matrix:

\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & t_x \\
0 & 1 & t_y \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}

2. Scaling

Scaling changes the size of an object by enlarging or shrinking it.

If scaling factors are  and :

x' = x \cdot s_x,\quad y' = y \cdot s_y

Scaling matrix:

\begin{bmatrix}
s_x & 0 & 0 \\
0 & s_y & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}

3. Rotation

Rotation turns an object about the origin or a fixed point by an angle .

For rotation about the origin:

x' = x\cos\theta - y\sin\theta

y' = x\sin\theta + y\cos\theta 

Rotation matrix:

\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta & 0 \\
\sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}

4. Reflection

Reflection produces a mirror image of an object about an axis.

About x-axis:


\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}

About y-axis:


\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}

5. Shearing

Shearing distorts the shape of an object by shifting its coordinates in one direction.

X-shear matrix:


\begin{bmatrix}
1 & sh_x & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}

Y-shear matrix:


\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
sh_y & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end
